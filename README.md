# Lateral transport of sinking particles in the Mediterranean Sea

Version 0.1.0

The goal of this project is to assess the impact of lateral transport on sinking paleoceanographic proxy carriers. 

trajectoryfiledataextraction.py takes in trajectory netCDF files generated using OceanPARCELS 2.1.6 and the NEMO flow field and gives information on the trajectory endpoints.

Soon to be made reproducible:
  R code to summarize the trajectory endpoint information by origin site and compare to proxy data from these points
  Python scripts to plot trajectories and endpoint information on a map
  R code to create other summary plots

Output generated by scripts run on Ubuntu 20.04 using Spyder 4.2.1, Python 3.6, R version 4.0.3.
